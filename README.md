Hello there!

I’m Skye, a junior UX/UI designer based in Ottawa, Ontario. I just graduated from college on October 2020.

As studying Interactive Media Design, I had opportunity to studied in many different areas, such as, graphic design, product design (UX/UI), motion graphic, web development, content management system (CMS), videography and photography. With the passion for designing website and mobile app, once I learned more about user experience and user-centered design, I decided to focus on this field to prepare for my career as a UX/UI designer.

With the experience that I gained in 2 year college, I am also able to work with front-end developers effectively as I understand basic programming languages., as well as to make product videos that serve other purposes for corporations. 

Outside of design, I love making videos on my personal Youtube channel about life and music. And since I’m a big fan of milk tea, I also enjoy working as a barista at a Taiwanese global franchise bubble tea shop in Ottawa. 

Want to share something with me? Or would like to work together? I’d love to hear from you!
